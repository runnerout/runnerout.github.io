                   <p> The Beach is a 2000 film directed by Danny Boyle based on the 1996 book of the same name written by Alex Garland.
                It stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Richard, a traveller seeking new and perhaps dangerous experiences in Thailand,
                where he receives a map that leads him to a mythical island.</p>

                <p>The film was initially poorly received, having a rating of 4/10, however over time that rose to 6.6/10.
                The biggest problem people have with the film are the characters, with whom nobody can seem to sympathize.</p?

                <p> Personally, i like this film not for the characters or the story, but rather for artistic reasons.
                The director did a superb job, the colors of the film evoke a feeling of warmth, and throughout the film there is a feeling of mystery.</p>

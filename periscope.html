                   <p>Down Periscope is a 1996 film directed by David S. Ward.
                   It stars Kelsey Grammer as a newly promoted submarine captain going on his first mission to play the opposing force in a wargame with a boat and crew that most would consider to be subpar.</p>
                   <p>I like this movie because it is genuinely funny, the timing of the jokes is great, the actors obviously knew what they were doing.</p>
